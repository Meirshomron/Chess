# Chess

Created the Chess board game in Unity 2019.3.15f1.

This is a great game to create as a stepping stone to improve your capabilities as a game developer.
The rules are widely known, the game has enough logic to enable different implementations and the use of different tools.

Game development is my passion and I created this game for fun and personal growth.
I'm a developer and worked on this game independently. The graphical aspects of the game are imported and not the current focus of this project.

To run the project, download/clone and run from unity.
